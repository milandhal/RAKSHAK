**RAKSHAK**🚘an Advanced Lane Assist System (ALAS)
Real-Time Lane Detection & Road Curvature Estimation

📌 Overview

The Advanced Lane Assist System (ALAS) is a computer vision-based driver assistance system that detects lane boundaries in real time using classical image processing techniques.

The system performs camera calibration, perspective transformation, lane pixel detection, curvature estimation, and overlays lane guidance information on video frames — simulating features found in modern ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).

This project demonstrates end-to-end pipeline development for intelligent automotive vision systems.
